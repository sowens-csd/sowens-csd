# Hi, I’m Stephen Owens

I've been building software since long before the Internet was a thing. I've learned a few things, 
mostly humility. Surprisingly I still enjoy it despite the lifelong battle with frustration. Some 
things I'm working on right now are:
* [Folktells](https://folktells.com/)
* [A plugin for Flutter to help use speech to text](https://github.com/csdcorp/speech_to_text)
* [An app for ice conditions on the Rideau Skateway](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/can-i-skate/id1610413272)

Structured data has been a lifelong obsession starting with Btrieve but only truly igniting when I 
encountered SGML. From there I've tried to at least sample almost all of the wonderful mess of data 
and metadata 'standards' that followed. RDF and Linked Data are in the current rotation.
